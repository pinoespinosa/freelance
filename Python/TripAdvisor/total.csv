"Le Petit Bernard","Traditional French food with specialty in fish of the day. With only 22 seats, the menu is short because you want to offer the maximum freshness of the products, with preparations of the day. The fixed menu includes the traditional ones like boeuf borgignon, rabbit or onion soup, and fish and seafood are always special of the day because they depend on the daily availability of the products. Our chef Bernard buys daily at dawn the fish and seafood that will use, which allow to guarantee freshness. The wine list is also brief but original. We work only with natural wines, similar to an organic wine (although in reality that concept does not exist for wines). The natural wines do not have addition of sulphites and that makes them very special, although the offer is reduced, it is worth.","+56 2 2638 2665","Jose Miguel de La Barra 453, Santiago 8320114, Chile","http://www.cafedelabarra.cl/petit-bernard/","cafedelabarra@gmail.com","French, Seafood","Tuesday  8:00 pm - 11:00 pm
